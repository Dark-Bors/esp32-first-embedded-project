# üåü OptiPulse‚Ñ¢State: Developer Training Project

Welcome to **OptiPulse‚Ñ¢State**, a hands-on embedded systems learning project focused on mastering **FreeRTOS**, **state machines**, **LED control**, **CLI interaction**, and **real-time camera streaming** ‚Äî all on the ESP32-S3.

This project mimics a simplified embedded operating state machine, commonly used in real-world firmware systems, with **defined states**, **LED-based feedback**, **timed logic**, and **robust transition handling**.

---

## üìå Project Purpose

To serve as a **learning platform** for embedded software and firmware design by:

- Practicing state machine implementation
- Applying FreeRTOS and multitasking
- Managing peripheral control (LED, camera, SD card)
- Handling persistent config (NVS and YAML parsing)
- Exploring real-world patterns like CLI tools and recovery logic

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### üîÅ State Machine Logic

The core of the system is built around a **finite state machine (FSM)** with the following states:

1. **DEV_MODE**  
   - Full CLI access over UART  
   - LED control commands (on, off, blink, duty cycle, frequency, etc.)  
   - Wi-Fi scanning and connection via CLI  
   - Real-time logs printed every ‚â§1s  
   - Loads configuration from a YAML file  
   - Magic key required to switch states  

2. **OPERATIONAL**  
   - LED behavior driven by config or runtime status  
   - Logs saved to SD card  
   - Real-Time View (RTV) supported with a timer-based session  
   - On command, splits into:
     - **TETHERED**:  
       ‚Ü≥ USB-connected; allows log transfer to PC, uses slow LED blink  
     - **UNTETHERED**:  
       ‚Ü≥ Wi-Fi log upload to cloud, with fallback to Tethered if failure occurs  
       ‚Ü≥ LED reflects network activity  

3. **HALTED**  
   - LED blinks rapidly at 5Hz  
   - System enters deep sleep indefinitely  
   - Can only be resumed by sending a CLI command with the **magic key**

## üîê Security Layer Implementation Concept

### ‚úÖ Security Levels Table

| Level | Description                        | Example Capabilities                               | GPIO Pattern (18, 19, 21) |
|-------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0     | üö´ No access                       | No CLI, no DEV actions, error-only                 | `000`                     |
| 1     | üõ† Limited access                  | CLI status, limited config queries                 | `001`                     |

### üß© Design Decisions Recap

1. **Security Logic Source**
   - Physical-layer check via 3 input GPIOs at startup (and maybe periodically).
   - Logic stored in:
     ```c
     int get_security_level_from_gpio(void);
     ```

2. **Integration Point**
   - Call at system boot (`state_machine_init()`) or CLI entry.
   - Store in a global `security_level` variable.
   - Guard sensitive CLI commands:  
     ```c
     if (security_level >= 2) { /* allow access */ }
     ```

3. **Magic Key Logic (Temporary)**
   - Currently uses plaintext CLI key:  
     `MAGIC_KEY = "unlocked_dev_123"`
   - Future upgrade: AES-256 + CRC + ESP Secure Boot
   - TODO: delete tag to clean it from production

4. **CLI & System Behavior by Security Level**

| Feature                 | Required Level |
|------------------------|----------------|
| View system state      | ‚â• 1            |
| View logs              | ‚â• 2            |
| Trigger RTV manually   | ‚â• 2            |
| Change operational state | ‚â• 3          |
| Reset NVS              | 3 only         |
| Enter HALTED from CLI  | 3 only         |

5. **Fail-Safe Handling**
   - If GPIO pattern is invalid ‚Üí fallback to `SEC_LEVEL_0`
   - In `SEC_LEVEL_0`, most actions are refused and warning is logged
